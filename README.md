# accessible-html5-dialog-demo

This is a fork of the [Google Chrome](https://github.com/GoogleChrome) [HTML5 dialog polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill).  It contains accessibility fixes to ensure it works correctly with assistive technologies on both desktop and mobile devices.  It uses the [accessibility.js](https://github.com/zoltan-dulac/accessibility.js) library.

More info on this demo can be read about on my blog post, [Creating Accessible HTML5 Modal Dialogs For Desktop and Mobile](https://www.useragentman.com/blog/?p=7603).
